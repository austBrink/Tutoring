# write a program that greets the user by their name. Do this by keeping their name (whatever you want it to be in a variable)

# anything in quotes is a string. 
# userName = 'Bob'
# print('Hello, ')
# print(userName)

# now modify the program to accept input for the user name

# print('Enter your name')
# # to get user input. use the input function...
# userName = input()
# print('Hello, ')
# print(userName)


# write a program that adds any two numbers that the user enters to the screen

# step 1 get the first number from the user. You'll need to store it in a variable.
# step 2 get the second number from the user 
# step 3 add the numbers 
# step 4 display to the screen 

# prompt the user by displaying a message
print('Please enter the first number in the sum')
firstNumber = int(input())
print('please enter a value for the second number')
secondNumber = int(input())
# create a new variable for the sum 
sum = firstNumber + secondNumber 
print(sum)

# python will add two 'strings' if you want it two. It will just put one value after the other. 
# python will only do math on numbers that have been converted to numbers 

# conditional statements 
# logical operators 
# functions 
# error handling 
# lists and arrays





















# Almost every program has input output. 

# in python we'll typically output to the terminal / screen via the print function... 

# we are going to 'call' the function print. And 'pass' the 'argument' "hello World". The print function takes that argument and displays it on the screen,
# print('Hello World')
# print(2)

# # variables a means to store a value in a container of memory called a variable. 
# # greet a user 
# userName = 'Bob'
# print("Hello,")
# print(userName)

# # display the sum of two numbers 

# firstNumber = 1 
# secondNumber = 3 

# print(firstNumber + secondNumber)

# #subtract the numbers 
# print(secondNumber - firstNumber)

# # multiplication 
# print(firstNumber * secondNumber)
